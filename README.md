# Git bisect demo

To learn about git bisect, checkout the presentation in the presentation folder, and consult documentation https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect.

To find the hash of the first commit quickly, run `git log --oneline start`, or use the start tag in your bisect commands.

Make sure to copy the script somewhere before using, otherwise it will
be gone during bisecting.
